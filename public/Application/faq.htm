  <br>
  </span></b><b><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>Our pets arrive in your home already spayed or neutered, and with all age appropriate vaccinations. </span></b></p>
<p align="center" class=MsoBodyText><b><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>We ask a varying minimum adoption donation as noted in the listing; this depends on adoptability, age, medical expenses, and length of time at the shelter. </span></b></p>
<p align="center" class=MsoBodyText><b><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>Like all desperate nonprofit animal rescue organizations, we gratefully accept adoption donations above the minimum from those who can afford to give more, but we have found many, many wonderful homes for our pets with families that could not afford more than our minimums. We celebrate those homes as ecstatically as we celebrate homes that can afford more, and we prefer that you not tell us how much you plan to donate until after your adoption has been approved. </span></b></p>
<p align="left" class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>The first step toward adoption is to fill out the application.</span></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Filling out the application in no way commits you to adopting</strong> - it simply enables us to get you preapproved, in case you decide you want to adopt. If you are then approved and offered a pet placement, you may always refuse the placement. If you accept a placement, we always give you three days (for puppies/kittens) or thirty days (for adult pets) to live with each other; if during that time you decide that your new pet simply won't work out, for any reason, we will accept the pet back with a full refund of your adoption donation. You could either return the pet directly to us, or have it picked up on our next transport to your area! I must say, we are very proud of our successful placement record - we really work hard to make sure you and your pet will be a great match.</font></p>

<p><strong>If you rent,</strong> we must obtain landlord permission prior to approving your application. If you are unable to get written approval as described on the application, please at least let us know your landlord's name and contact information so we can speak with them directly. </p>
<p>The best<strong> photos to send for dog applications </strong>would be photos of your fence, yard, home, any dog-specific areas like kennels or dog runs, and any photos of your current or former pets you would like to share. </p>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For<strong> cat adoptions,</strong> just send us some photos of your home that you think show how much a kitty would love it there, and photos of your current or former pets. We know cats just laugh at your fence, and don't care if you live in a huge home or a cozy cottage! <br>
  <br>
  For the <strong>vet reference</strong>, if you currently own a pet, we need the vet that has records of that pet's vaccinations. If you don't currently own a pet, but have owned pets in the past 10 years, we need the vet that you feel would be most likely to still have records in your name. If you now own, or have ever owned, a pet, be sure the vet reference you give will be able to find records in your name; if the records are in a different name, please let us know what name and why. We absolutely must confirm the vaccination status of pets currently living with you before we can place a new pet in your home. If we call the vet, and they say they have never heard of you, this is not a good thing (ha). If this is your first pet ever, congratulations on joining the pet world! We will consider your application without a vet reference, but we would like to know what vet you think you will use for your pet. Without a vet reference, please be sure to provide at least two strong personal references who would know how you are with animals. Please note, some dog placements will require a vet reference, and the vet reference is often used as a &quot;tie-breaker&quot; when more than one applicant wishes to adopt the same pet. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If we have an upcoming <strong>transport</strong> scheduled to your area, we will make every effort to process and approve your application in time for the transport. Our regular transports to <strong>Monroe or Spokane </strong>do not cost anything extra, but an optional donation to help us cover our transport expenses (which can be as high as $240 per trip) is always appreciated from those who can afford to help. <strong>Other areas</strong> have transport possible, and the fee is dependent on the number of pets on the transport and the distance our driver must go. We do adopt to Canadians, but you must pick up your pet on this side of the border; contact us for further information. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you have any additional comments or information you wish to share beyond that which is covered in the application, please use the comments section at the end. We will contact you within 24 hours of receiving your application; if you do not hear from a real person (rather than an auto-generated 'thanks for your application' message) within 24 hours, please either email us or call us - it's possible your application was eaten in cyberspace (it's rare, but it can happen). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanks so much for looking at shelter pets, they really make the best buddies!</font><br>
