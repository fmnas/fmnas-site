<p>
    Jareth joined our family in 2006. My daughter and I fell in love with him at first sight. He was hunkered down in the back of a cage at a high-kill shelter, covered with ticks after living on a woodpile in the country.
<p>
    Despite his rough background he was a loving fuzzball who greatly enriched our lives for the next 13 years. He was the talkiest cat ever and informed us of many secrets of the universe, even though being human we were not smart enough to understand him.
   <p> 
    He left us in May this year for that great catnip field in the sky. We miss him but will hold him close in our hearts forever. His final gift was freeing up a spot for Hunter and Goliath to join us.
   <p> 
    Well done, Jareth! We will not see his like again. ‚ù§
