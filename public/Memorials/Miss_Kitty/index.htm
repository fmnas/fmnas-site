	<p>Miss Kitty was an alley cat who adopted me to be her caretaker in the last year of her life. She was a wonderful cat and in fact brought me Little Man, who at the time was a scrawny and very scared alley kitten. I thought perhaps he might have been her son, but it turns out he was not! Just another cat in need and I guess Miss K was smart enough to know a sucker for kitties when she saw one! Miss Kitty made sure that her adopted family was taken care of and then one day decided she could leave us to handle the future on our own. She is missed.
