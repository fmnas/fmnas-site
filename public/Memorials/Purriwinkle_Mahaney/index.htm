	<h1>Purriwinkle Mahaney</h1>
	<img src="Purri.jpg">

	<p>Precious Purriwinkle&mdash;a face so round and sweet,<br>
A purr so loud that neighbors<br>
Could hear him down the street.
<p>
Our home was his for fifteen years; we never had a spat.<br>
Though others tried, they could not oust<br>
Our Purri as "Top Cat".
<p>
No meows or prrrts or huffs or puffs did this kitty make;<br>
Just gentle paws upon a cheek<br>
To say "it's time to wake".
<p>
One tiny bit of mischief was beyond belief;<br>
From top of desk to under couch&mdash;<br>
He was a pencil thief.
<p>
The five of us he left behind miss him terribly.<br>
But we know he's now with Snag and Sneak,<br>
Still playing wild and free.
