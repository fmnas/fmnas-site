        Taco, Chloe, and Nitro all arrived at Forget Me Not after both of their people died unexpectedly. These three seniors are, of course, heartbroken and confused. Of the three, Chloe is the most nervous and is really bonded with Taco, so we are requiring those two to be adopted to the same family. If you have room for three, they would love to bring their friend Nitro along, too, but he is confident enough to be adopted by himself if necessary.
<p>
These little ones each weigh under 10 pounds and have the typical sweet but nervous chihuahua disposition. After arriving at the shelter, they spent a few days decompressing in a foster home where they surprised everyone by enjoying attentions from children as well as the adults in the family. When given enough time to adapt and in a calm, loving environment, they seem to thrive and settle in quickly.
<p>
Chloe is the youngest of the group, at 7 1/2, while Taco is the eldest at 12. Nitro is in between at 9.
<p>
They are all having dental cleanings with any necessary extractions, and all have had geriatric blood panels run, with no serious concerns shown. All three have some knee issues, but as small dogs, they are managing pretty well; we'd recommend adding some joint supplements to their regular care.
<p>
Nitro has already completed his dental work and is ready to go home; Taco and Chloe will be able to go home after 3/4, when their dentals have been completed.

            <p>
                All pets arrive spayed/neutered, dewormed, microchipped and vaccinated. Adoption fee is a suggested minimum of $50 (more gratefully accepted), or Senior for Senior - adopters over 65 may name their own adoption fee. All pets are placed with a 30-day money-back trial period, to give pet and family enough time to discover any unknown allergies or other conflicts.
<p>
                Can't come to Republic? Don't let that stop you! We have monthly transports to both the Seattle area and Spokane, delivering adopted pets to their new owners. If you can add a little to your donation to help us cover our transport expenses, that would be great!                <p>
