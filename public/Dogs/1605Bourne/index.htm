		Bourne is a 50-pound boisterous pup, born 7/17/21. Based on appearance,
		he may have some heeler, maybe some hound, and a whole lot of
		who-knows-what in the mix - what we lovingly call a LeMutte pup! They
		are the best kind, each one is totally unique.
<p>
		He was transferred in from a neighboring shelter, and is the
		quintessential diamond-in-the-rough pup. He has a wonderful, loving
		heart and a fun character. Bourne arrived with no real training, other
		than appearing to be housetrained. His enthusiasm for every kind word,
		treat, or moment of affection spills over into the typical overexcited
		pup behaviors of jumping, mouthing, nose-booping. He is extremely treat
		motivated, and thanks to the success the staff and volunteers had in
		turning around these overexcitement issues in Kane, Bourne is now
		beginning an in-shelter behavior modification plan, under which positive
		behaviors like remaining calm and sitting for treats are rewarded while
		unwanted behaviors are ignored or shunned (never punished - we advocate
		for positive training methods, teach the dog what behavior you want,
		never punish for unwanted behavior). He is a smart cookie, and will
		learn quickly and carry on learning once in his new family.
<p>
		Bourne would love an active family with some experience with positive
		dog training (or the willingness to enroll in training classes with him
		- remember, training is 99% about training the humans in how to
		communicate with the dog!). Due to his rambunctious nature, we recommend
		no toddlers (aka, "human bowling pins" for an enthusiastic 50-pound
		doggo). Older, sturdy, patient kids who can understand and follow
		training tips would be great. We have not cat-tested Bourne yet, and
		based on his excitability, it's pretty safe to assume he would chase a
		cat that runs. What he would think about a cat that just sits there, we
		don't know - but if you have a dog-savvy cat, we will be happy to test
		Bourne out with one of our shelter "cat potatoes" (non-dog-reactive
		cats) to see how he does. He seems to enjoy the company of other dogs
		and might benefit from having a similarly sized canine companion;
		otherwise, he'd be quite happy as an only dog, as long as he had food,
		shelter, love, and clear training instructions. Dogs like Bourne thrive
		when they understand what is expected of them; we could easily see
		Bourne picking up activities like agility, search and rescue, or just
		hiking.

            <p>
	            All pets arrive spayed/neutered, dewormed, microchipped and vaccinated.
	            Adoption fee is a suggested minimum of $125 (more gratefully accepted).
	            All pets are placed with a 30-day money-back trial period, to give pet
	            and family enough time to discover any unknown allergies or other conflicts.
<p>
	            Can't come to Republic? Don't let that stop you! We have monthly
	            transports to both the Seattle area and Spokane, delivering adopted pets
	            to their new owners. If you can add a little to your donation to help us
	            cover our transport expenses, that would be great!
