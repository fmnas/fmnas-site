		Poor Bella. She had a human who absolutely adored her, and they were a
		terrific team... until the human's health began to fail. Bella stuck
		with her person right to the end, when he was no longer able to take her
		for walks/play outside, and his love for her was communicated through
		hugs and treats. Lots of treats.
<p>
		When Bella's human died, she was left heartbroken and homeless, and has
		now joined our little Forget Me Not family. When she first arrived, this
		6 year old girl, who should weigh somewhere between 50-60 pounds,
		weighed a whopping 92 pounds. Through some gentle exercise and portion
		control, she is currently down to about 84 pounds, and is hoping for her
		very own Biggest Loser coach to adopt her and help her with regular
		walks so she can regain her stamina and get back into healthy shape (as
		we middle-aged gals know, this can be a challenge at Bella's phase of
		life).
<p>
		Bella had a full blood panel run to be sure there was no medical reason
		for her obesity, and the good news is, everything in the blood panel
		looked great! That means slow and steady weight loss is the key for
		Bella; by the end of 2022, she is hoping to be in great condition and
		enjoying her walkies with her person (maybe even actual hikes, once
		she's in better shape).
<p>
		Right now, she seems about as active as a potato, but that will change
		with your help! What Bella DOES have is an enormous capacity for love -
		she can't wait for a new person to spot that sparkle in her eye and say
		"YES, you are the one I've been waiting for!"
<p>
		Bella is fine with other dogs out in the wild, but would prefer to be
		the only dog in the home, as she is used to being a "just me and my
		person" dog and tends to get jealous if she has to share her person's
		affection with another dog. She would do great in a home with more than
		one person, too! We think she will be fine with children (as long as
		they treat her well, of course). She has not been cat-tested yet, but if
		you have a resident feline, we'll be happy to do so for you.
<p>
		I can think of dozens of our past adopters who would be PERFECT for
		Bella... unfortunately, they all already HAVE their "Bella" - so, what
		do you think, are you going to be our NEW adopter who goes all-in to be
		Bella's companion? She will be devoted (even if you give her green beans
		for treats) and will be an excellent companion.

            <p>
	            All pets arrive spayed/neutered, dewormed, microchipped and vaccinated.
	            Adoption fee is a suggested minimum of $125 (more gratefully accepted).
	            All pets are placed with a 30-day money-back trial period, to give pet
	            and family enough time to discover any unknown allergies or other conflicts.
<p>
	            Can't come to Republic? Don't let that stop you! We have monthly
	            transports to both the Seattle area and Spokane, delivering adopted pets
	            to their new owners. If you can add a little to your donation to help us
	            cover our transport expenses, that would be great!
