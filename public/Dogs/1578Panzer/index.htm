    <p>
        Panzer is a 12 year old girl we affectionately call "Grandma." She has an inoperable large fibrosarcoma on her side; the veterinarian who diagnosed her said she doesn't currently appear to be in any significant pain from it, and her arthritic pains are being managed with daily Rimadyl.
<p>
        We are looking for a hospice foster home to help Panzer work through a bucket list of fun. We are pretty sure she would like to include:
        <ul>
        <li> try a pupperccino
        <li> visit the ocean
        <li> eat a cheeseburger (just a SMOL one)
        <li> snuggle in bed with someone who loves her
        </ul>
        <p>
        I'm sure you can think of plenty more to add - let's make her last months (vet thinks maybe up to a year) her best months! No dog should die in a shelter, waiting for love.
        <p>
        Forget Me Not will pay all medical expenses for Panzer in her foster home until it is time for her to earn her wings (her foster caregiver will have the most say in that).

            <p>
                Panzer is spayed, microchipped, dewormed and has suffered through the last vaccinations she will ever need (not even a LOLLIPOP!!). She will be, in effect, YOUR dog, except that Forget Me Not will pay her medication and veterinarian costs for life. Can you provide the love, snuggles, and fun?
<p>
                Can't come to Republic? Don't let that stop you! We have monthly transports to both the Seattle area and Spokane, delivering adopted pets to their new owners. If you can add a little to your donation to help us cover our transport expenses, that would be great!
