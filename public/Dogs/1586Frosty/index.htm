		What a transformation! Those of you who have been watching Kane since he
		first arrived at the shelter several months ago are not going to BELIEVE
		this is the same dog.
<p>
		Kane, a beautiful black Labrador/shepherd mix born 5/31/2020, came in as
		an untrained, undisciplined, big (70-pound) dog with a great heart but
		no manners whatsoever - a full grown year-old puppy without a clue.
<p>
		We brought in a trainer, worked with Kane, the staff, and the volunteers
		to find the best ways to motivate and communicate with Kane, and this
		boy has completely changed how people react to him. In the early days,
		seeing Kane running toward you would elicit an "oh, no!" and you'd need
		to brace yourself for his enthusiastic leap into your arms (he never did
		understand why no one could catch him). Now, everyone says "YAY, it's
		Kane, what a good boy!"
<p>
		Kane is eager to please, he is potty trained, waits patiently for his
		turn to go outside and returns happily for his treat (which he receives
		gently, such a good boy). While he loves some good exercise and playing
		outside, you can often find Kane relaxing on the couch, snuggled up with
		a volunteer. He soaks up every little bit of love he can! Though he can
		jump up occasionally in his excitement and joy, he is easily redirected.
		Kane knows how to sit and stay. He catches onto routine quickly and is a
		smart boy ready to learn more commands and tricks!
<p>
		Kane does have a high prey drive so should not be placed with cats,
		poultry, or other small "living squeaky toys." He does enjoy playing
		with similarly sized friendly dogs who are up for some energetic romping
		and wrestling; if you have a big, playful dog at home, we recommend
		coming to Republic to let your dog and Kane meet prior to adoption, as
		dogs - like people - can sometimes be selective about their friends. Due
		to Kaneâ€™s size and very playful nature, we recommend only older children
		in his home as toddlers may be too small for his goofy enthusiasm. Kane
		is a very happy, loving boy ready to be your next best friend!
<p>
		The video shows what a good boy Kane is - and he's not even 2 years old
		yet, so has many terrific years to spend with you!

            <p>
                All pets arrive spayed/neutered, dewormed, microchipped and vaccinated. Adoption fee is a suggested minimum of $125 (more gratefully accepted). All pets are placed with a 30-day money-back trial period, to give pet and family enough time to discover any unknown allergies or other conflicts.
<p>
                Can't come to Republic? Don't let that stop you! We have monthly transports to both the Seattle area and Spokane, delivering adopted pets to their new owners. If you can add a little to your donation to help us cover our transport expenses, that would be great!<p>
