		Frosty, reported to be a Westie/Scottie mix, transferred in from an out of county shelter, where she ended up after her owner (a backyard breeder) died. Frosty arrived quite pregnant - no fun at all for a lady of upper ages like Frosty (she is approximately 8 years old), but Frosty settled into her foster home well and had five healthy, happy puppies.
<p>
		The pups are all weaned and spoken for and Frosty's days as a senior mama are OVER. She was so relieved to realize she gets to have a kennel all to herself now, and now her lifetime of love and pampering with no responsibilities other than being a great listener and a fun companion can begin!
<p>
		As is often the case with dogs from backyard breeders, nearly EVERYTHING is new to Frosty. You can expect that she will not know what a television is, doesn't yet understand play, and has lived a very sheltered and unfulfilling existence for her first 8 years. Let's make the NEXT 8 fantastic!
<p>
		She is very gentle about receiving petting and treats, is learning about being brushed and starting to relax into the process. She is housetrained but does have some occasional submissive urination when she is feeling nervous - which will probably be quite often at the beginning of her new life with you, but will improve as she builds in confidence and blossoms with your love.
<p>
		She is a petite girl at under 15 pounds, and will benefit from a good relationship with your favorite groomer. (We are hoping to get her groomed in mid-February, once her spay incision is totally healed). She's had a dental cleaning and a geriatric blood panel, so you and your vet will have a baseline for the future.
<p>
		Frosty kind of needs an emotional support human... and she promises to return the favor as soon as she realizes she is, finally, HOME, where she is loved and wanted. She will do fine as an only pet, or likely would be fine with a dog-savvy cat. We'd love to find a home where Frosty can be the only dog, or where she only has to share the love with one other small dog who will let her relax in her retirement.

            <p>
                All pets arrive spayed/neutered, dewormed, microchipped and vaccinated. Adoption fee is a suggested minimum of $50 (more gratefully accepted), or Senior for Senior - adopters over 65 may name their own adoption fee. All pets are placed with a 30-day money-back trial period, to give pet and family enough time to discover any unknown allergies or other conflicts.
<p>
                Can't come to Republic? Don't let that stop you! We have monthly transports to both the Seattle area and Spokane, delivering adopted pets to their new owners. If you can add a little to your donation to help us cover our transport expenses, that would be great!<p>
