        Oslo, born 7/10/21, arrived at the shelter four months ago along with his much more outgoing brother. His brother was quickly adopted, but Oslo's shy nature finds him getting overlooked time and again for the popular kids... while Oslo stands against the wall wondering why no one wants to bring him home.
<p>
        We say "CHIN UP, Oslo!" We know some lucky person is going to bring this sweet boy home and allow him to BLOSSOM. He loves a good game with a wand toy, and that is always an excellent ice-breaker. While it may take Oslo a little longer than the typical "ambassador cat" to settle in and be comfortable in his new home, winning him over will be well worth the wait.
        <p>
        As you can see, he has grown a bit, um... portly... while waiting for his new family to find him. Don't worry, Oslo, we all understand comfort eating, especially after the past couple of years... once you have a best friend to play with those wand toys and then snuggle you on the couch, you won't need to fill your empty space inside with extra kibble - it will be filled with purrs and love.

        We'd love to see all kittens go to homes that have another young, playful kitten, or to send 2 of them out as a pair (which gives you a great pair discount rate), but we do not require pair adoptions. If you prefer to adopt just one, and you don't have a similarly aged kitten at home already, please read our information on <a href="http://forgetmenotshelter.org/blog/single-kitten-syndrome">Single Kitten Syndrome</a>. Then, when you apply for a single kitten, please let us know in the "Comments" field how you plan to deal with the "kitten crazies."
<p>
        All kittens arrive spayed/neutered, dewormed, microchipped and with all age-appropriate vaccinations. Adoption fee is suggested $35 SHY CAT SPECIAL (more gratefully accepted). Discount available for pair adoptions! All pets are placed with a 30-day money-back trial period, to give pet and family enough time to discover any unknown allergies or other conflicts.
<p>        
        Can't come to Republic? Don't let that stop you! We have monthly transports to both the Seattle area and Spokane, delivering adopted pets to their new owners. If you can add a little to your donation to help us cover our transport expenses, that would be great!
