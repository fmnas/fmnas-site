    <p>
        Pickles is an affectionate and happy tabby-Siamese mix boy, about 8 years old. He arrived at the shelter as a stray, and no one has claimed him.
<p>
        When Pickles arrived, he was fighting a persistent Feline Rhinotracheitis Virus upper respiratory infection which, though no longer causing nasal symptoms or respiratory discomfort, has left his beautiful baby blues a bit sore and red-rimmed. This is a common infection in cats, and generally resolves on its own, with some topical antibiotic support being given to Pickles' eyes to help while he heals. It is not a serious disease in most cases (including Pickles), but is prone to becoming a latent infection that may flare up during times of stress.
        <p>
        Pickles says this means he requires daily snuggles and belly rubs, plus a little play time, some excellent sun-spots, and all the love you can spare. He seems tolerant of other cats, and has not yet been tested with dogs. If you have a dog and would like to add Pickles to the family, let us know about your dog in your application, and we will find a similar cat-friendly dog for Pickles to meet before adoption.
        <p>
        Pickles may be considered a "senior" at 8, but with a loving and attentive home, he knows he has many more wonderful years to spend with you! He would be happy as an indoor-only or indoor/outdoor cat, and is most definitely going to want to snuggle with you in bed on those dark winter mornings.

    <p>
        All pets arrive spayed/neutered, dewormed, microchipped and vaccinated. Adoption fee is a suggested minimum of $20 (more gratefully accepted) or Senior for Senior (adopters over 65 can name their own adoption fee). All pets are placed with a 30-day money-back trial period, to give pet and family enough time to discover any unknown allergies or other conflicts.
<p>
        Can't come to Republic? Don't let that stop you! We have monthly transports to both the Seattle area and Spokane, delivering adopted pets to their new owners. If you can add a little to your donation to help us cover our transport expenses, that would be great!
