        Coffee is part of our "Brunch Bunch," a group of 5 young adult cats who were left behind when their owner moved away. This entire group will do well as indoor only or indoor/outdoor cats. They can be adopted in pairs or singly, and will be happy no matter what.
<p>
Coffee, born 10/1/18, is a lovely and affectionate shorthaired black female with just a touch of white at her throat. She really enjoys being petted, is not too sure she likes being picked up and held, and is a terrific combination of affection and independence. Coffee is not going to be the sort to bother you all day long to play with her - give her a comfortable spot to chillax, and she will be just fine. She obviously does well with other cats. If you have a dog, we will be happy to dog-test her for you!

        All pets arrive spayed/neutered, dewormed, microchipped and vaccinated. Adoption fee is a suggested minimum of $40 (more gratefully accepted). All pets are placed with a 30-day money-back trial period, to give pet and family enough time to discover any unknown allergies or other conflicts.

Can't come to Republic? Don't let that stop you! We have monthly transports to both the Seattle area and Spokane, delivering adopted pets to their new owners. If you can add a little to your donation to help us cover our transport expenses, that would be great!
