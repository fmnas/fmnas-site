	    Callie is a gorgeous senior calico, about 11 years old, who was adopted last year by a wonderful family; unfortunately, their living situation changed and they were no longer able to keep Callie safe from their "obnoxious" big dogs, who wouldn't give Callie any peace. They made the difficult decision to let Callie find a new retirement home, where she can relax in a sunspot, watch football on the back of the couch, lie in front of the fireplace... all the important Cat Retirement Activities.
<p>
	    Callie got our primo senior pampering, including a geriatric blood panel and a dental cleaning. Her bloodwork shows no issues at this time, although she may need to cut back on the junk food to keep her glucose in line. She will do best on a canned or fresh food diet, with a minimum of dry food (this is true for most senior cats - dry food is convenient for we humans, and less expensive, but not ideal for senior cat metabolism).
<p>
	    Callie is tolerating the other cats in her cat room, but really feels they are beneath her - and she may be right, who are we to question her belief that she is The Queen? She would love to be the only cat, though might accept a resident kitty-in-waiting if they were properly subservient to her greatness. She was OK with a dog that did NOT harass her, but would not like to have any dog that looks forward to playing "fetch the living squeaky toy" with an ol' lady Queen Cat.
<p>
	    Don't let her age fool you - she still enjoys a good wand-toy-stalking!
<p>
	    Want it to be just you and your cat? Callie says that is a fantastic idea, she would love to have a one-on-one human partner who sees and shares her wonderfulness.

<p>
	All pets arrive spayed/neutered, dewormed, microchipped and vaccinated. Adoption fee is a suggested minimum of $25 (more gratefully accepted) or Senior for Senior (adopters over 65 can name their own adoption fee). All pets are placed with a 30-day money-back trial period, to give pet and family enough time to discover any unknown allergies or other conflicts.
<p>
Can't come to Republic? Don't let that stop you! We have monthly transports to both the Seattle area and Spokane, delivering adopted pets to their new owners. If you can add a little to your donation to help us cover our transport expenses, that would be great!
