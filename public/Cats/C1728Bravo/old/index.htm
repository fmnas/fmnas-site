        Introducing the Alphabet Litter! These kittens arrived at the shelter, along with their mama Bones, when they were just 3 weeks old, the victims of a move to a home that would not allow cats. Bones and her kittens are now ready to find new homes of their own. The kittens were born on 8/7/21.
<p>
        These kittens have been well socialized from birth, and will fit in beautifully with just about any type of family and home. They have never experienced outdoors, so should remain indoor-only cats, or be allowed out only in a catio or supervised on harness/leash. The kittens in this litter are:
        <p>
        C1727 Alpha - white with tabby patches shorthair female<br>
        C1728 <strong>Bravo</strong> - grey tabby with white shorthair female<br>
        C1729 Charlie - grey tabby with white shorthair male<br>
        C1730 Delta - brown tabby with white shorthair female

        We'd love to see all kittens go to homes that have another young, playful kitten, or to send 2 of them out as a pair (which gives you a great pair discount rate), but we do not require pair adoptions. If you prefer to adopt just one, and you don't have a similarly aged kitten at home already, please read our information on
        <a href="http://forgetmenotshelter.org/blog/single-kitten-syndrome">Single Kitten Syndrome</a>. Then, when you apply for a single kitten, please let us know in the "Comments" field how you plan to deal with the "kitten crazies." 
            <p>


                All kittens arrive spayed/neutered, dewormed, microchipped and with all age-appropriate vaccinations. Adoption fee is suggested $65 (more gratefully accepted). Discount available for pair adoptions! All pets are placed with a 30-day money-back trial period, to give pet and family enough time to discover any unknown allergies or other conflicts.
<p>
                Can't come to Republic? Don't let that stop you! We have monthly transports to both the Seattle area and Spokane, delivering adopted pets to their new owners. If you can add a little to your donation to help us cover our transport expenses, that would be great!
