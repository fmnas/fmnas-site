        <p>
        Forget Me Not is currently assisting a semi-feral cat colony in crisis in Inchelium. These cats are too friendly to be "just" barn cats, and cannot be returned to their original site after neuter because there are dogs in the neighborhood that have decide the colony is their prey playground. As a result, we currently have 28 kittens from this colony, ranging in age from 2 1/2 months to 6 months. All of them are seeking a safe place to call home; it can be indoor only, indoor-outdoor, or for some of them, outdoor only with appropriate food, water, shelter, and daily affection.
<p>
        Some are more outgoing than others, and we'll do our best to describe their individual purrrrsonalities, as well as sharing videos. All of them are, naturally, afraid of dogs, though the younger and more outgoing kittens may adapt to a friendly dog.
        <p>
            Our next four kittens were all born about 6/21/21:
<p>
            SS10 TEXAS -  black short-haired male (bigger than Alabama), quite playful and outgoing, should adapt quicker than some to a new home<br>
            SS11 ALABAMA -  black short-haired male (smaller than Texas), quite playful and outgoing, also should be quicker to adapt than some<br>
            SS12 OHIO - black and white medium-haired male, auditioning to be the new Grumpy Cat, he is my favorite (and you will feel so great when he decides you're an OK human)<br>
            SS13 <strong>KANSAS</strong> - grey tabby short-haired female, skittish but handleable, terrified by life but willing to keep trying<br>

            <p>
                We'd love to see all kittens go to homes that have another young, playful kitten, or to send 2 of them out as a pair (which gives you a great pair discount rate), but we do not require pair adoptions. If you prefer to adopt just one, and you don't have a similarly aged kitten at home already, please read our information on 
                <a href="http://forgetmenotshelter.org/blog/single-kitten-syndrome">Single Kitten Syndrome</a>. Then, when you apply for a single kitten, please let us know in the "Comments" field how you plan to deal with the "kitten crazies."
<p>
                All kittens arrive spayed/neutered, dewormed, microchipped and with all age-appropriate vaccinations. Adoption fee is suggested $65 (more gratefully accepted). Discount available for pair adoptions! All pets are placed with a 30-day money-back trial period, to give pet and family enough time to discover any unknown allergies or other conflicts.
<p>                
                Can't come to Republic? Don't let that stop you! We have monthly transports to both the Seattle area and Spokane, delivering adopted pets to their new owners. If you can add a little to your donation to help us cover our transport expenses, that would be great!
