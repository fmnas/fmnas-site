        Forget Me Not is currently assisting a semi-feral cat colony in crisis in Inchelium. These cats are too friendly to be "just" barn cats, and cannot be returned to their original site after neuter because there are dogs in the neighborhood that have decided the colony is their prey playground. As a result, we have taken in 41 cats and kittens from this colony, kittens ranging in age from 2 1/2 months to 6 months. All of them are seeking a safe place to call home; it can be indoor only, indoor-outdoor, or for some of them, outdoor only with appropriate food, water, shelter, and daily affection.
<p>
        Connecticut, born 10/1/19, is one of the few adults in this colony who we felt needed to be removed and rehomed as a pet. She just doesn't have the wild demeanor of a true feral adult, and seems to enjoy being held and petted; the more she is held and petted, the more friendly she gets. She will like a calm and relaxed home, with someone who has the patience to let her blossom at her own pace.
        <p>
        She gets along fine with other cats, but we do NOT recommend dogs for Connecticut.
        <p>
        The good news is, Forget Me Not is having a "Shy Cat Special" for the rest of 2021, so a shy cat or kitten has a $35 adoption fee, and you may add a second shy cat as a buddy at no additional cost!

    <p>
        We'd love to see all kittens go to homes that have another young, playful kitten, or to send 2 of them out as a pair (which gives you a great pair discount rate), but we do not require pair adoptions. If you prefer to adopt just one, and you don't have a similarly aged kitten at home already, please read our information on
        <a href="http://forgetmenotshelter.org/blog/single-kitten-syndrome">Single Kitten Syndrome</a>. Then, when you apply for a single kitten, please let us know in the "Comments" field how you plan to deal with the "kitten crazies." 
          <p>
            All kittens arrive spayed/neutered, dewormed, microchipped and with all age-appropriate vaccinations. Adoption fee is suggested $35 SHY CAT SPECIAL (more gratefully accepted). 2 shy cats for the price of one! All pets are placed with a 30-day money-back trial period, to give pet and family enough time to discover any unknown allergies or other conflicts.
<p>
            Can't come to Republic? Don't let that stop you! We have monthly transports to both the Seattle area and Spokane, delivering adopted pets to their new owners. If you can add a little to your donation to help us cover our transport expenses, that would be great!
