	    Who is in the market for a stunning, sleek, sophisticated house panther? Tokio, born about 6/1/21, is a beautiful and somewhat reserved girl who arrived as a stray. She had been hanging around the person's home for quite some time before finally asking them for help, and she is now beginning to trust humans again, and is willing to be held and petted. She has not become a super outgoing cat just yet, but we expect her to blossom in the right family.
<p>
	    Tokio is good with other cats, does NOT like dogs, does NOT like loud children (no toddler birthday parties in her future, please), and would LOVE a quiet, introspective child who wants to read with her, or share dreams in their room on a rainy day.
<p>
	    She will do well as an indoor-only or indoor-outdoor cat (though we always recommend indoor living as it is safest for the cat as well as the neighborhood birds). Tokio is an undemanding, easy-keeper kitty, though we cannot promise she won't turn into one of those overly devoted cats that wakes you up every morning by tapping your nose with her paw. She just needs a chance to be part of a family - given that chance, who knows WHAT lovely purrrrrsonality traits will emerge?

<p>
	All pets arrive spayed/neutered, dewormed, microchipped and vaccinated. Adoption fee is a suggested minimum of $50 (more gratefully accepted). All pets are placed with a 30-day money-back trial period, to give pet and family enough time to discover any unknown allergies or other conflicts.
	<p>
	Can't come to Republic? Don't let that stop you! We have monthly transports to both the Seattle area and Spokane, delivering adopted pets to their new owners. If you can add a little to your donation to help us cover our transport expenses, that would be great!
