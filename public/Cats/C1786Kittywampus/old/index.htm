        Kittywampus was surrendered to the shelter when the person caring for him was injured and no longer able to provide care. He arrived at Forget Me Not somewhat shut-down and traumatized from a life lived outside only for over 6 years, where he found a way to evade predators and survive the highest and lowest of temperatures through the seasons. You can see, both in his photos where he sort of freezes like a loaf or a "monorail" cat, and in his video where he seems resigned to his fate, whether that means being petted or being eaten, that he has a ways to go to regain his self confidence. He is a very gentle cat who is tolerant of all sorts of people. He would most appreciate a calm and quiet home where he could either be an indoor-only cat with access to perches and maybe a catio, or an indoor-outdoor cat (after a long indoor-only acclimation period). His previous caregiver said he was not good with other cats or dogs, so he would likely appreciate being the only pet in his home.

        Kittywampus is eligible for our Shy Cat Special - $35 adoption fee.
        <p>
        We think Kittywampus is going to blossom into a wonderful and devoted companion, and from how much he likes being petted (in spite of trying SO HARD to resist our volunteers' charms), we think he will be blissfully curled up on your lap and keeping the end of your bed warm in almost no time. A little patience and the gift of a home for a scared boy will result in an immeasurable reward for both of you!

    <p>
        All pets arrive spayed/neutered, dewormed, microchipped and vaccinated. Adoption fee is a suggested minimum of $35 - SHY CAT SPECIAL (more gratefully accepted). All pets are placed with a 30-day money-back trial period, to give pet and family enough time to discover any unknown allergies or other conflicts.


        <p>Can't come to Republic? Don't let that stop you! We have monthly transports to both the Seattle area and Spokane, delivering adopted pets to their new owners. If you can add a little to your donation to help us cover our transport expenses, that would be great!
