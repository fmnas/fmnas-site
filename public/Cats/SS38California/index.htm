        California, born 10/1/18, is an adult from a feral colony on which we were doing TNR. After getting to know her, we felt she was worthy of a status upgrade to House Panther (aka, a pet). She came in with a terrible case of allergic dermatitis, generally indicative of an allergy to fleas. She has since been treated for fleas, treated with steroids and antibiotics to clear up her skin, and is now a sleek black beauty who is accustomed to handling and is quite tolerant of being picked up and petted. She will like a calm and relaxed home, and we recommend she be kept indoor only to avoid a repeat of her dermatitis.
<p>
She gets along fine with other cats, but we do NOT recommend dogs for California. You can see in her video how much she enjoys attention; we can't imagine asking this beautiful girl to live out her life outside as a feral cat! She would like a calm home, and would be fine as an only cat if you just want one panther.
<p>
The good news is, Forget Me Not is having a "Shy Cat Special", so a shy cat or kitten has a $35 adoption fee, and you may add a second shy cat as a buddy at no additional cost! 
    <p>

    <p>
        All kittens arrive spayed/neutered, dewormed, microchipped and with all age-appropriate vaccinations. Adoption fee is suggested $35 SHY CAT SPECIAL (more gratefully accepted). 2 shy cats for the price of one! All pets are placed with a 30-day money-back trial period, to give pet and family enough time to discover any unknown allergies or other conflicts.
<p>
        Can't come to Republic? Don't let that stop you! We have monthly transports to both the Seattle area and Spokane, delivering adopted pets to their new owners. If you can add a little to your donation to help us cover our transport expenses, that would be great!
