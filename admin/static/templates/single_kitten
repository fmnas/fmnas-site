We'd love to see all kittens go to homes that have another young, playful kitten, or to send 2 of them out as a pair (which gives you a great pair discount rate), but we do not require pair adoptions. If you prefer to adopt just one, and you don't have a similarly aged kitten at home already, please read our information on [Single Kitten Syndrome](https://forgetmenotshelter.org/blog/single-kitten-syndrome). Then, when you apply for a single kitten, please let us know in the "Comments" field how you plan to deal with the "kitten crazies."
