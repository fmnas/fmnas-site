<p>All pets arrive spayed/neutered, dewormed, microchipped and vaccinated. Adoption fee for {{pet.name}} is a suggested minimum of {{pet.fee}} (more gratefully accepted). All pets are placed with a 30-day money-back trial period, to give pet and family enough time to discover any unknown allergies or other conflicts.

Can't come to Republic? Don't let that stop you! We have monthly transports to both the Seattle area and Spokane, delivering adopted pets to their new owners. If you can add a little to your donation to help us cover our volunteer driver's expenses, that would be great!
